🎓 **Who Am I?**  
A curious engineer-in-the-making from **IIT Jodhpur**, obsessed with turning caffeine and code into magic. I live at the intersection of **AI**, **web dev**, and **chaotic late-night debugging**. 🚀

---

🛠️ **Tech Playground**  
I speak both human and machine (but mostly to my terminal). Here's my toolbox:

- **Languages:** C++, Python, JavaScript, SQL  
- **Web Dev:** React.js, HTML/CSS, Flask, Firebase, Express  
- **ML/AI:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, NumPy, OpenCV  
- **Tools & Infra:** Docker, Git, Postman, GCP, VS Code  
- **OS:** Linux (my natural habitat), Windows (for Zoom calls)

🔥 **Stuff I’ve Built**

🧠 [**Autocomplete Search Engine**](https://github.com/Varchasva-Raj-Saxena/AutoCompleteSearchBar)  
> A smart search bar that actually *gets* you. Think Trie, LSTM, and GCP—wrapped in a full-stack bow.

👁️ [**Face Recognition Attendance System**](https://github.com/Varchasva-Raj-Saxena/Face-Identification)  
> Walk into class, look at the cam, boom — attendance logged. Flask, Firebase, Docker... this one’s watching 👀

🌫️ [**Image Dehazing Research**]  
> Making foggy images crystal clear using deep learning magic (AOD-Net, DW-GAN, etc.). Coming soon to a research paper near you.

---

💼 **What I’ve Been Up To**  
**Frontend Intern @ PT Darshi (Bharat) Pvt. Ltd.**  
Built smooth, slick, and responsive interfaces for an e-learning platform using **React.js**. Collaborated across teams, squashed bugs, and shipped features like a champ.

---

🎯 **Things I Like Doing**  
- Building side-projects that *almost* break the internet  
- Diving deep into ML papers and re-inventing the wheel... better  
- Participating in hackathons, open-source, and over-engineering stuff for fun  
- Solving puzzles, writing clean code, and breaking production (just once... maybe twice)
